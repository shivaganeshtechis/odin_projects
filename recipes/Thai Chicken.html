        <li>1 cup very thinly sliced fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>2 cups hot cooked rice</li>

    <h3>Steps : </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather ingredients.</li>
        <li>Whisk chicken broth, oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, white sugar, and brown sugar together in a bowl until well blended.</li>
        <li>Heat large skillet over high heat. Drizzle in oil. Add chicken and stir fry until it loses its raw color, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in shallots, garlic, and sliced chilies. Continue cooking on high heat until some of the juices start to caramelize in the bottom of the pan, about 2 or 3 more minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Add about a tablespoon of the sauce mixture to the skillet; cook and stir until sauce begins to caramelize, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Pour in the rest of the sauce. Cook and stir until sauce has deglazed the bottom of the pan. Continue to cook until sauce glazes onto the meat, 1 or 2 more minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Stir in basil. Cook and stir until basil is wilted, about 20 seconds. Serve with rice.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
